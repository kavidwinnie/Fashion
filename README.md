Fashion image compatibility is a compelling concept in computer vision, aiming to determine the compatibility of different fashion items presented in an image. This aspect is pivotal in the fashion industry, contributing significantly to consumer satisfaction, and can be further utilized for sophisticated fashion matching and recommendation systems. This project introduces a fashion image compatibility recommendation model that leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks and object detection methodologies. This fusion is designed to augment the effectiveness and precision of the compatibility evaluation process, thus providing more reliable and personalized fashion recommendation.
